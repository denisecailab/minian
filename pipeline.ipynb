    "This section assumes you already have some background knowledge about the CNMF algorithm.\n",
    "Please refer to the [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010843) for detailed information of the algorithm. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick recap, here is the essential idea of CNMF:\n",
    "We believe our movie, `Y`, with dimensions `height`, `width` and `frame`, can be written in (and thus broken down as) the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{A}^T \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{b}^T \\mathbf{f} + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `A` is the spatial footprint of each unit, with dimension `height`, `width` and `unit_id`.\n",
    "* `C` is the temporal activities of each unit, with dimension `unit_id` and `frame`.\n",
    "* `b` and `f` are the spatial footprint and temporal activities of some background, respectively.\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that strictly speaking, matrix multiplication is usually only defined for two dimensional matrices, but our `A` here has three dimensions, so in fact we are taking the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) of `A` and `C`, reducing the dimension `unit_id`.\n",
    "This might seem to complicate things (compared to just treating `height` and `width` as one flattened `spatial` dimension), but it ends up making some sense.\n",
    "When you take a dot product of any two \"matrices\" on a certain **dimension**, all that is happening is a **product** followed by a **sum** -- you take the product for all pairs of numbers with the the same indexes from the two \"matrices\", and then you take the sum of all those products along the dimension.\n",
    "Thus when we take the tensor product of `A` and `C`, we are actually multiplying all those numbers in dimension `height`, `width` and `frame`, matched by `unit_id`, and then take the sum.\n",
    "Conceptually, for each unit, we are weighting the spatial footprint (`height` and `width`) by the fluorecense of that unit on given `frame`, which is the **product**, and then we are collapsing all units together, which is the **sum**.\n",
    "With that, the equation above is trying to say that our movie is made up of a weighted sum of the spatial footprint and temporal activities of all units, plus some background and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another rule about `C` that separates it from background and noise:\n",
    "Each \"row\" of `C`, which is the temporal trace for each unit, should be described as an [autoregressive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) (AR process), with a parameter `p` defining the **order** of the AR process:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\gamma_i c(t-i) + s(t) + \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $c(t)$ is the calcium concentration at time (`frame`) $t$.\n",
    "* $s(t)$ is spike/firing rate at time $t$.\n",
    "* $\\epsilon$ is noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this equation is trying to say that at any given time $t$, the calcium concentration at that moment $c(t)$ depends on the spike at that moment $s(t)$, as well as its own history up to `p` time-steps back $c(t-i)$, scaled by some parameters $\\gamma_i$s, plus some noise $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "Another intuition of this equation comes from looking at different `p`s: when `p=0`, the calcium concentration is an exact copy of the spiking activities, which is probably not true.\n",
    "When `p=1`, the calcium concentration has an instant rise in response to a spike followed by an exponential decay.\n",
    "When `p=2`, calcium concentration has some rise time following a spike and an exponential decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, CNMF tries to find the spatial matrix (`A`) and temporal activity (`C`) (along with `b` and `f`) that best describe `Y`.\n",
    "There are a few more important practical concerns: Firstly we cannot solve this problem in one shot -- we need to iteratively and separately update `A` and `C` to approach the true solution.\n",
    "Often enough,  two iterations  after the initialization seem to give good enough results, but you can always add more iterations.\n",
    "Secondly, by intuition you may define \"best describe `Y`\" as the results that minimize the noise/error $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "However we have to control for the [sparsity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) of our model as well, since we do not want every little random pixel that happens to correlate with a cell to be counted as part of the spatial footprint of the cell (non-sparse `A`), nor do we want a tiny spike at every frame trying to explain every noisy peak we observe (non-sparse `C`).\n",
    "Thus, the balance between fidelity (minimizing error) and sparsity (minimizing non-zero entries) is an important concern for both the spatial and temporal update."
