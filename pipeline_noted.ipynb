    "\n",
    "The purpose of this annotated version of the minian pipeline is to guide the user through each step of the code, working with a short demo movie. The intention is to enable the user to understand the code as much as possible so that they are equipped with the knowledge necessary to customize the code for their own needs, regardless of prior programming skills. This version is **not** supposed to be run as a production tool for analyzing your own videos. If you click \"Run All\" on this document, you **will** likely encounter errors. For the purposes of your own analyses, consider modifying the accompanying **pipeline.ipynb** and **batch_processing.ipynb** to suit your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, it s highly recommended that you get familiar with basic python concepts and operations like [string manipulation](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/string.html), [tuples, lists and dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html), as well as a little bit about [object-oriented programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) and [python modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another note on the styling of this document: most of the sentences should hopefully make sense if taken literally. However, some special formatting of the text is used to demonstrate the close relationship between the concepts discussed and the code, as well as encouraging the reader to understand the Python syntax. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  a [hyperlink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) usually points to a well-defined python module, class or methods, especially when that concept is first encountered in this document. The link usually points to the official documentation of that concept, which in some cases might not be the best place to start for a beginner. If you find the documentation puzzling, try to google the concept in question and find a tutorial that best suits you.\n",
    "-  an inline `code` usually refers to a name that already exsists in the [namespace](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces) (i.e. the context where we run the codes in this document). It can be a previously encountered concept, but more often it referes to variable names or method names that we [imported](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html) or have defined along the way.\n",
    "-  **bold** texts are used more loosely to highlight anything that requires more attention. Though they are not used as carefully as previous formats, they often refer to specific values that a variable or method arguments can assume.\n",

    "# Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the workflow below, there are 7 main sections in this pipeline. Results will be saved along the way, following **Motion correction**, **Background removal**, **Initialization**, and **CNMF**. Therefore, when you run through the pipeline, if you decide to restart/shutdown the kernal before you finish, you don't have to re-run everything  the next time you want to pick this up (with the exception of the **Setting Up** module). For example, if you restart/shutdown the kernal after **Initialization**, when you return to your data you can simply rerun the **Setting Up** module, and then go directly to **CNMF**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the pipeline, we will also introduce the most powerful and important aspect of this pipeline -- parameter exploring.  **CNMF** has been daunting to some because of the many parameters involved in its implementation. The purpose of minian's interactive visualization steps is to make the impact of all parameters transparent to users by allowing them to view the direct impact of parameter manipulation on the data, helping them to find the parameters best suited to their data. We will go into greater detail on how to use and interpret these viusalization steps later on, but for now, just know that if you are daunted by CNMF, these steps will likely be the most helpful.\n",

Both the `keys` (field names) and `values` (numbers indicating which level of folder name should be used) of `meta_dict` can be modified to suit your data structure. `overwrite` is a boolean value controlling whether the data is overwritten if a file already exsists. We set it to `True` here so you can easily play with the demo multiple times, but **use extreme caution** with this during actual analysis -- in addition to erasing prior data that may be important to you, under certain circumstances it is possible for existing file structures to cause compatibablity issues and data will be saved improperly.

The argument `pattern` is optional and is the [regular expression](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) used to filter files under the specified folder. The default value **'msCam[0-9]+\\.avi$'** means that a file can only be loaded if its filename contains **'msCam'**, followed by at least one number, then **'.avi'** as the end of the filename. This can be changed to suit the naming convention of your videos. `dtype` is the underlying [data type](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/user/basics.types.html) of the data. Usually `uint8` is good and should be preferred to save memory demand. The resulting \"video array\" `varr` contains three dimensions: `height`, `width`, and `frame`. If you wish to downsample the video, pass in a `dictionary` to `downsample`, whose keys should be the name of dimensions and values an integer specifying how many times that dimension should be reduced. For example, `downsample=dict('frame'=2)` will temporally downsample the video with a factor of 2. Instead, if you do not wish to downsample your data, simply pass in `downsample=None`. `downsample_strategy` will assume two values: either `'subset'`, meaning downsampling are carried out simply by subsetting the data, or `'mean'`, meaning a mean will be calculated on the window of downsampling (the latter being slower).\n",

    "The idea is that we select some subset of frames, compute a max projection of those frames, and find the local maxima of that max projection. We keep repeating this process and putting together all the local maxima we get along the way until we get an overly-complete set of local maxima/bright-spots, which are the potential locations of cells. We call them **seeds**. The assumption here is that the center of cells are brighter than their surroundings on some, but not necessarily all, frames. The first and only required argument `seeds_init` takes is the video array we want to process (here, `Y`). There are four additional arguments controlling how we subset the frames: `wnd_size` controls the window size of each chunk (*i.e* the number of frames in each chunk); `method` can be either `'rolling'` or `'random'`. For `method='rolling'`, the moving window will roll along `frame`, whereas for `method='random'`, chunks with `wnd_size` number of frames will be randomly selected; `stp_size` is only used if `method='rolling'`, and is the step-size of the rolling window, or in other words, the distance between the **center** of each rolling window. For example, if `wnd_size=100` and `stp_size=200`, the windows will be as follows: **(0, 100)**, **(200, 300)**, **(400, 500)** *etc.* Obviously that was a **bad** choice since you probably want the windows to overlap or you will miss cells. `nchunk` is only used if `method='random'`, and is the number of random chunks we will draw. Additionally we have two parameters controlling how the local maxima are found. `'max_wnd'` controls the window size within which a single pixel will be choosen as local maxima. In order to capture cells with all sizes, we actually find local maximas with different window size and merge all of them, starting from **2** all the way up to `'max_wnd'`. Hence `'max_wnd'` should be the radius of the **largest** cell you want to detect. Finally in order to get rid of local maxima with very little fluctuation, we set a `'diff_thres'` which is the minimal fluorescent diffrence of a seed across `frame`s. Since the linear scale of the raw data is preserved, we can set this threshold emprically.\n",

We will go line by line: First we create a `list` of frequencies we want to try out -- `noise_freq_list`. The \"frequency\" values here are a proportion of your **sampling rate**. Note that if you have temporally downsampled, the proportion here is relative to the downsampled rate. Then we randomly select 6 seeds from `seeds_gmm` and call them `example_seeds`, which in turn help us pull out the temporal traces from the movie `Y_flt`.  The traces of the `example_seeds` are assigned to `example_trace`. We then create an empty dictionary `smooth_dict` to store the resulting visualizations. After initializing these variables, we use a `for` loop to iterate through `noise_freq_list`, with one of the values from the list as `freq` during each iteration. Within the loop, we run `smooth_sig` twice on `example_trace` with the current `freq` we are testing out. The low-passed result is assigned to `trace_smth_low`, while the high-pass result is assigned to `trace_smth_high`. Then we make sure to actually carry-out the computation by calling the `compute` method on the resulting `DataArray`s. Finally, we turn the two traces into visualizations: we construct interactive line plots ([hv.Curve](http://holoviews.org/reference/elements/bokeh/Curve.html)s) from them and put them in a container called a [hv.HoloMap](http://holoviews.org/reference/containers/bokeh/HoloMap.html). Again if you are confused about how the visualization works, you can check out [the tutorial](http://holoviews.org/getting_started/Introduction.html).

    "`pnr_refine` stands for \"peak-to-noise ratio\" refine. The \"peak\" and \"noise\" here are defined differently from before. First we seperate/filter the temporal signal for each seed based on frequency -- the signals composed of the lower half of the frequency are regarded as **real** signals, while the higher half of the frequencies is presumably **noise** (\"half\" being relative to [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency)). Then we take the peak-to-valley value (really just **max** minus **min**, or, [np.ptp](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.ptp.html)) for both the **real** signal and **noise** signal. Then, \"peak-to-noise ratio\" is the ratio between the `np.ptp` values of **real** and **noise** signals. So, the critical assumption here is that real cell activity is of lower frequency while noise is of a higher frequency, and they seperate at approximately half the Nyquist frequency, or, one-fourth of the sampling frequency of the video.  Moreover, we don't want those \"seeds\" whose **real** signals are buried in **noise**. If these assumptions does not suit your recordings - for example, if you have a really low sampling rate, or if your video are unavoidably noisy - consider skipping this step. The function `pnr_refine` takes in `varr` and `seeds` as its first two arguments; the `noise_freq` that best separates signal and noise, which hopefully has been determined from the previous cell; and `thres`, a threshold for \"peak-to-noise ratios\" below which seeds will be discarded. Pragmatically `thres=1` works fine and makes sense. You can also use `thres='auto'`, where a gaussian mixture model with 2 components will be run on the peak-to-noise ratios and seeds will be selected if they belong to the \"higher\" gaussian. `med_wnd` is the window size of the median filter that gets passed in as `size` in [`scipy.ndimage.filters.median_filter`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.1/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.filters.median_filter.html). This is only useful in rare cases where the signal of some seeds assume a huge change in baseline fluorescence and it is not desirable to keep such seeds. In this case the median-filtered signal is subtracted from the original signal to get rid of the artifact. In other cases `'med_wnd'` should be left to `None`.\n",

In addition, it's very beneficial to smooth the signals before running the correlation, and again `noise_freq` determines how smoothing should be done. In addition to feeding in a number, such as the noise frequency you defined earlier during `seeds_refine_pnr`, you can also use `noise_freq='envelope'`.  When `noise_freq='envelope'`, a hilbert transform will be run on the temporal traces of each seed and the correlation will be calculated on the envelope signal. Any pair of seeds that are within `thres_dist` **and** has a correlation higher than `thres_corr` will be merged together, such that only the seed with maximum intensity in the max projection of the video will be kept.

After generating `A`, for each seed, we calculate a weighted average of pixels around the seed, where the weight are the initial spatial footprints in `A` we just generated. We use this weighted average as the initial estimation of temporal activities for each units in `C`. Finally, we need two more terms: `b` and `f`, representing the spatial footprint and temporal dynamics of the **background**, respectively.

    "This section assume you already have some knowledge about using CNMF as a method of extracting neural activities from video. If not, it is recommended that you read [the paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010843), to get a broad understanding of the problem and proposed solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick reminder, here is the essential idea of CNMF: We believe our movie, `Y`, with dimensions `height`, `width` and `frame`, can be written in (and thus broken down as) the following equation: $$\\mathbf{Y} = \\mathbf{A} \\cdot \\mathbf{C} + \\mathbf{b} \\cdot \\mathbf{f} + \\epsilon$$ where `A` is the spatial footprint of each unit, with dimension `height`, `width` and `unit_id`; `C` is the temporal activities of each unit, with dimension `unit_id` and `frame`; `b` and `f` are the spatial footprint and temporal activities of some background, respectively; and $\\epsilon$ is the noise. Note that strictly speaking, matrix multiplication is usually only defined for two dimensional matrices, but our `A` here has three dimensions, so in fact we are taking the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product) of `A` and `C`, reducing the dimension `unit_id`. This might seem to complicate things (compared to just treating `height` and `width` as one flattened `spatial` dimension), but it ends up making some sense. When you take a dot product of any two \"matrices\" on a certain **dimension**, all that is happening is a **product** followed by a **sum** -- you take the product for all pairs of matching numbers coming from the two \"matrices\", where \"match\" is defined by their index along said dimension, and then you take the sum of all those products along the dimension. Thus when we take the tensor product of `A` and `C`, we are actually multiplying all those numbers in dimension `height`, `width` and `frame`, matched by `unit_id`, and then take the sum. Conceptually, for each unit, we are weighting the spatial footprint (`height` and `width`) by the fluorecense of that unit on given `frame`, which is the **product**, and then we are overlaying all units together, which is the **sum**. With that, the equation above is trying to say that our movie is made up of a weighted sum of the spatial footprint and temporal activities of all units, plus some background and noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, there is another rule about `C` that separates it from background and noise, and saves it from being just some random matrix that happens to fit well with the data (`Y`) without having any biological meaning. This rule is the second essential idea of CNMF: each \"row\" of `C`, which is the temporal trace for each unit, should be described as an [autoregressive process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) (AR process), with a parameter `p` defining the **order** of the AR process: $$ c(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\gamma_i c(t-i) + s(t) + \\epsilon$$ where $c(t)$ is the calcium concentration at time (`frame`) $t$, $s(t)$ is spike/firing rate at time $t$ (what we actually care about), and $\\epsilon$ is noise. Basically, this equation is trying to say that at any given time $t$, the calcium concentration at that moment $c(t)$ depends on the spike at that moment $s(t)$, as well as its own history up to `p` time-steps back $c(t-i)$, scaled by some parameters $\\gamma_i$s, plus some noise $\\epsilon$. Another intuition of this equation comes from looking at different `p`s: when `p=0`, the calcium concentration is an exact copy of the spiking activities, which is probably not true; when `p=1`, the calcium concentration has an instant rise in response to a spike followed by an exponential decay; when `p=2`, calcium concentration has some rise time following a spike and an exponential decay; when `p>2`, more convoluted waveforms start to emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all this in mind, CNMF tries to find the spatial matrix (`A`) and temporal activity (`C`) (along with `b` and `f`) that best describe `Y`. There are a few more important practical concerns: Firstly we cannot solve this problem in one shot -- we need to iteratively and separately update `A` and `C` to approach the true solution -- and  we need something to start with (that is what **initilization** section is about). Surprisingly often times 2 iterative steps after our initialization seem to give good enough results, but you can always add more iterations (and you should be able to easily do that after reading the comments). Secondly, by intuition you may define \"best describe `Y`\" as the results that minimize the noise $\\epsilon$ (or residuals, if you will). However we have to control for the [sparsity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) of our model as well, since we do not want every little random pixel that happens to correlate with a cell to be counted as part of the spatial footprint of the cell (non-sparse `A`), nor do we want a tiny spike at every frame trying to explain every noisy peak we observe (non-sparse `C`). Thus, the balance between fidelity (minimizing error) and sparsity (minimizing non-zero entries) is an important idea for both the spatial and temporal update."

Here the **l1-norm** is a proxy to control for the sparsity of `A`. Ideally to promote sparsity we want to control for the number of non-zero entries in `A`, which is the [l0-norm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space#When_p_=_0). However optimizing for the l0-norm is typically [computationally hard to do](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/269298/why-do-we-only-see-l-1-and-l-2-regularization-but-not-other-norms), and it is usually good enough to use **l1-norm** instead as a proxy.\n",

    "Now, in theory we want to update every entry in  `A` iteratively with the above two goals in mind. However, updating that amount of numbers in `A` is still computationally very demanding, and it is much better if we can breakdown our big problem into smaller chunks that can be parallelized (making things much faster). **CNMF** is all about solving the issues caused by overlapping neurons, so it is best to keep the dependency across units (along dimension `unit_id`) and update these entries together. However, it should be fine to treat each pixel as independent and update different pixels separately (in parallel). Thus, our new, \"smaller\" problem is: for each pixel, find the corresponding pixel in `A`, across all `unit_id`, that give us smallest **l1-norm** as well as smallest **error** when multiplied by `C`. In equation form, this is:\n",

Similarly $Y_{ij}$ is the corresponding pixel in `Y` which will only have the dimension `frame` left. Thus, $\\left \\lVert Y_{ij} - A_{ij} \\cdot C \\right \\rVert ^2$ is our **error** term and $\\left \\lvert A_{ij} \\right \\rvert$ is our **l1-norm**. Moreover, we put these two terms together as a unitary target function/common goal to be minimized, with $\\alpha$ controlling the balance between them. This balance can be seen by considering the impact of $\\alpha$: the higher the value of $\\alpha$, the greater the contribution the **l1-norm** term makes to the common goal (target function), the more penalty/emphasis you place on sparsity, and as a result, the more sparse `A` will be.

    "There is yet another parameter, `dl_wnd`, that is relevant to practical consideration. Recall that we are updating $A_{ij}$ for our \"small\" problem, which has the dimension `unit_id` and has `A.sizes['unit_id]` number of entries (that is, the number of units). This is computationally feasible, but still a lot, especially when you do this for all pixels. One way to reduce computational demand is to leave out certain units when updating certain pixels -- in particular, it does not make sense to consider a unit that is supposed to be at the top left corner of the field of view when we update a pixel in the bottom right corner. In other words, for each pixel, we solve the \"small\" problem with only a subset of all potential units, thus hugely increasing the speed of `update_spatial`. This is where `A_init` comes into play (actually the only place it is used -- we do not need `A` at all for the update itself). We compute a morphological dilation, like that used during [background removal](#background-removal), on `A_init`, unit by unit, with window size `dl_wnd`, and we use the result as a **masking matrix**. Then, during the actual update of any given pixel, only units that have a non-zero value at the corresponding pixel in the **masking matrix** will be considered for update. In other words, we are allowing each unit to expand from `A_init` up to a distance of `dl_wnd`, and killing off any possibility beyond that range. The rationale of using `dl_wnd` here is that even if for some reason we have only one non-zero pixel representing the center of a certain unit in `A_init`, that unit can potentially expand to a full size cell, but anything beyond that would probably be either part of other cells or random noise. Thus, we want to set `dl_wnd`to approximately the radius of the largest cell to help ensure we get a clean footprint for all cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have a boolean parameter, `update_background`, controlling whether we want to update the background in this step. This is the only place in the pipeline that the background will be updated, and the way it is updated is by essentially treating `b` as another `unit` and updating it according to the temporal activity `f`. Pragmatically since the morphology-based [background removal](#backgroun-removal) works so well at cleaning the backgrounds, this updating has little impact on the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the actual implementation of the optimization method, it is hard for the computer to set some variables to absolutely zero. Instead, we usually have a very small float numbers in place of zeros. `zero_thres` solves this by thresholding all the values and setting anything below `zero_thres` to zero. You want to use a very small number for `zero_thres`. Setting `zero_thres='eps'` will use the [machine epsilon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon)(the smallest non-negative number a machine can represent) of current datatype.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have an additional step after everything: normalization so that the spatial footprint of each unit has unit-norm. In practice we found that normalizing the result helps promoting the numerical stability of the algorithm, and enable us to interpret the spatial footprints as \"weights\" on each pixel so that the temporal activities are in the same scale space across units and can be compared. However normlizing spatial footprint for each unit does not preserve the relationship between overlapping cells in terms of their relative contribution to the activities of shared pixels. If such interpretation is critical for your downstream analysis, consider turning this off.\n",

    "Similar to the spatial update, given  the spatial footprint of each unit (`A`), our goal is now to find the activity of each unit (`C`) that minimizes both the **error** (`Y - A.dot(C, 'unit_id')`) and the **l1-norm** of `C`. However there is an additional constraint: the trace of each unit in `C` must follow an autoregressive process. Due to this additional layer of complexity, things becomes more computationaly expensive.  To reduce computatioinal cost, first observe that `A` is usually much larger than `C` (you usually have more total pixels than `frame`s), and performing the dot product, `A.dot(C, 'unit_id')`, everytime you try a different number in `C`,  is infeasible. Thus, we convert our **error** term to something like $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y} - \\mathbf{C}$, where $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ represents a matrix that can \"undo\" what `A` usually does to `C` -- instead of weighting the temporal activity of each unit by its spatial footprint (converting a matrix with dimension `unit_id` and `frame` into one with dimensions `height`, `width` and `frame`), $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ \"extracts\" the temporal activity of each unit based upon their spatial footprint (converting a matrix with dimension `height`, `width` and `frame` into one with dimensions `unit_id` and `frame`). In other words, $\\mathbf{A}^{-1}$ is like an [inverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore–Penrose_inverse) of `A`. This way, we only need to calculate $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ once and be done -- we can use that result everytime we update `C`. The calculation of $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ is rather complicated and not strictly mathematically accurate, but it provides a good approximation with huge computational benefit, and is the default behavior of CaImAn. You can turn this off by supplying `use_spatial=True` -- however that is usually too computationally demanding to do. We will assume `use_spatial=False` in the following discussion and call the $\\mathbf{A}^{-1} \\cdot \\mathbf{Y}$ term `YrA`, as in the code. The second thing to observe is that we cannot keep the `unit_id` dimension and chop up the `frame` dimension for parallel processing (like how we chopped up pixels during the spatial update), since we have to check whether each trace along the `frame` dimension follows an autoregressive process. Instead, we turn to the `unit_id` dimension to make our problem \"smaller\". Since we have a relatively good `A` now, it should be OK to update units that are not spatially overlapping independently. This idea should work if you have a relatively sparse distribution of cells. However if your field-of-view is packed with cells, if we were to consider cells overlapping if they share only one pixel, we would likely end up having to update `C` altogether, since every cell is transitively overlapping with every other cell. Instead, we put a threshold on how we define \"overlap\", and that is what `jac_thres` is for -- only cells that have an area of their spatial footprint overlapping that is more than this threshold (ranging from 0 to 1) will be considered \"overlapping\". (The \"proportion of overlapping area\" has a formal name: [Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index), hence the name `jac_thres`). Pragamatically `jac_thres=0.2` works for data that is very compact in cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn to the \"other layer of complexity,\" which is the autoregressive process. Recall that the temporal trace of each unit should be fitted by the following equation: $$c(t) = \\sum_{i=0}^{p}\\gamma_i c(t-i) + s(t) + \\epsilon$$ The first thing we want to determine is `p`. As discussed before, `p=2` is a good choice if your calcium transients have an observable rise-time. `p=1` might work better if the rise-time of your signal is faster than your sampling rate and you thus don't need to explicitly model it. Notably, `p>2` could result in [over-fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting) and is not recomended unless you are certain that your calcium traces have a more complicated waveform. Next, notice that we have several $\\gamma_i$s unaccounted for (though usually not too many if `p` is small). Luckily, we do not have to iteratively update these -- it turns out that the $\\gamma_i$s of an autoregressive process are related to the [autocovariance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocovariance) of the signal at different lags, which can be readily computed from `YrA`. For full derivation of these relationships, please refer to the [original CNMF paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627315010843?via%3Dihub). Here, we will merely assume that the parameters that affect how much a signal depends on its own history are related to the covariance of the signal when you shift it by different temporal lags. In this way, $\\gamma_i$s can be computed rather deterministicly. Say you set `p=2` and thus you have two $\\gamma_i$s to be estimated -- you would need exactly two equations involving the autocovariance function up to 2 time-step lags to give you the two $\\gamma_i$s. However, you can add additional equations using different lags to better model the propogation of signal, since the impact of $\\gamma_i$s can theoretically extend infinitely back in time, and should be reflected in the autocovariance function at any additional lag. In practice, we use a finite number of equations, solved with [least squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_squares). Thus it is important to choose an appropriate number of **additional** equations, which is what `add_lag` controls. An `add_lag` that is too small like `add_lag=0` will leave everything to the first `p` number of equations and autocovariance functions, which might not be reliable. Pragmatically, smaller `add_lag` values tend to bias the $\\gamma_i$s to give a much faster decay, whereas larger `add_lag` values tend to give a longer decay. **As a rule of thumb, it is usually good to set `add_lag` to approximately the decay time of your signal (in frames).** \n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have estimated the $\\gamma_i$s, the calcium traces, $c(t)$, and spikes, $s(t)$, are essentially **one thing** -- given calcium traces and how they rise/decay in response to spikes, we can deduce where the spikes happen, and *vice versa*. We can express this determined relationship with a matrix $\\mathbf{G}$ where $s(t) = \\mathbf{G} \\cdot c(t)$. In other words, $\\mathbf{G}$ is the matrix that \"undoes\" what $\\gamma_i$s do to $s(t)$. With all these parameters sorted out, we finally come to the actual optimization problem:\n",

    "Just as during the spatial update, we select some units ($i$), and update their calcium dynamics ($\\mathbf{C}_i$) based on the **error** and the **l1-norm** of the **spikes** ($\\mathbf{G}_i \\cdot \\mathbf{C}_i$). Again, it does not make sense to have negative calcium dynamics or spikes, so that is a constraint on the problem. Moreover, we need an $\\alpha$ to provide balance between fidelity and sparsity, which can be scaled up and down with `sparse_penal` (`sparse_penal=1` is equivalent to the default behavior of CaImAn). Furthermore, $\\alpha$ should depend on the expected level of noise. Note that we cannot use `sn_spatial` since that was the noise for each pixel, and we need the noise for each unit. The function `update_temporal` estimates the noise of each unit for you -- you just have to tell it the `noise_freq`uency. Like before, **0.5** is the highest you can go. With the default, `noise_freq=0.25`, the higher frequency half of the signal will be considered noise. In addition to affecting the estimation of noise power, `noise_freq` affects another smoothing process: when estimating $\\gamma_i$s, it is usually helpful to run a filter on the signal to get rid of high freqeuency noise, particularly when you don't have a large `add_lag`. The parameter, `noise_freq` is the cut-off frequency of the low-pass filter run on the temporal trace for each unit.  Additionally, you can set the value of `use_smooth` to control whether the filtering is done at all. Even with this careful design, however, it is sometimes hard to approach the true solution to the problem. When that happens, `update_temporal` will warn you by saying something like \"problem solved sub-optimally\". Usually, a few of these warnings is OK, but if you see this warning a lot it either means your parameters are unreasonable or you need more iterations to approach the real answer. You can use `max_iters` to control how many iterations to run for each small problem before the computer gives up and throws a warning. Furthermore, in some very, very rare cases, the default [ecos solver](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver) (the algorithm that does all the heavy-lifting) can fail and throw a \"problem infeasible\" warning, and it's worth trying a different solver, namely [scs](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver).  Be aware that scs produces results with very, very slow performance. The boolean parameter `scs_fallback` controls whether the scs attempt should be made before giving up. Importantly, both increasing `max_iters` and using `scs_fallback` will significantly increase the computation time and will not help at all if the parameters you provided are unreasonable to begin with, so try to use this only as a last resort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after the optimization is done, and just like [`update_spatial`](#first-spatial-update), we have a `zero_thres` to get rid of the small numbers, after which we can do a `post_scal` to counter the artifacts introduced by the **l1-norm** penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update_temporal` takes in `Y`, `A`, `b`, `C`, `f`, and `sn_spatial` (even if we won't need it by default), in that order. Optionally you can pass in `noise_freq`, `p`, `add_lag`, `jac_thres`, `use_spatial`, `sparse_penal`, `max_iters`, `use_smooth`, `scs_fallback`, `zero_thres` and `post_scal`, as we have discussed. `update_temporal` returns much more than we expected -- in addition to `C_temporal` and `S_temporal`, which are the results we care most about, it also returns `YrA`, and `g_temporal` (the $\\mathbf{G}$ matrix for each unit). Moreover, it returns `B_temporal`, `C0_temporal` and `sig_temporal`, representing the final layer of complexity: when we update the temporal trace, there might be a global baseline calcium concentration, which is modeled by $b$ and returned in `B_temporal`. A spike may also have happened right before recording starts and the resulting calcium transient could still be decaying in the first few seconds, so we model this with an initial calcium concentration, $c_0$, that follows the same decaying pattern defined by $\\gamma_i$s, and is returned in `C0_temporal`. Both $b$ and $c_0$ are single numbers that get updated along with the calcium dynamics for each unit. Finally there is `sig_temporal` which is the combination of all the signals, that is: `C_temporal + C0_temporal + B_temporal`\n",

[Explore the xarray documentation](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/io.html) for all IO options, and moreover, [numpy IO capabilities](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/routines.io.html), since `xarray` is built on top of `numpy`."
